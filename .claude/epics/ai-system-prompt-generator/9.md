# Task: Backend API Server and Core Services Setup

## Description
Setup FastAPI server with Python, implement core service architecture, create API routes foundation, integrate with MySQL and Redis. This task establishes the modern Python backend infrastructure that will serve as the foundation for all API endpoints and business logic services with automatic API documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FastAPI server setup with Python 3.11+ and uvicorn
- [ ] API router structure with proper dependency injection
- [ ] Service layer architecture with FastAPI dependencies
- [ ] MySQL database connection using SQLAlchemy ORM and connection pooling
- [ ] Redis integration using aioredis for async caching and session storage
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with custom exception handlers
- [ ] Health check endpoints for monitoring database and Redis connectivity
- [ ] CORS middleware configuration for frontend integration
- [ ] Request/response validation using Pydantic models
- [ ] Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation

## Technical Details
- Use FastAPI with Python 3.11+ and uvicorn for high-performance async ASGI
- Implement layered architecture: API Routes → Services → Repositories
- Configure MySQL connection using SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async support and connection pooling
- Setup Redis client using aioredis with async connection retry logic
- Use Python's structured logging module with proper log levels and formatters
- Implement FastAPI exception handlers with standardized error response format
- Configure CORS middleware with environment-specific origins
- Setup request/response validation using Pydantic models with automatic schema generation
- Create base service classes with dependency injection pattern
- Implement health check endpoints with async database and Redis connectivity tests
- Configure automatic OpenAPI documentation with FastAPI

## Dependencies
- [3] Project Setup and Environment Configuration - Required for base project structure
- [4] Database Schema Design and Setup - Required for database integration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
