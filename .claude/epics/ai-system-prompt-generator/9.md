# Task: Backend API Server and Core Services Setup

## Description
Setup Express.js API server with TypeScript, implement core service architecture, create API routes foundation, integrate with MySQL and Redis. This task establishes the backend infrastructure that will serve as the foundation for all API endpoints and business logic services.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Express.js server setup with TypeScript configuration
- [ ] API routing structure with proper middleware chain
- [ ] Service layer architecture with dependency injection
- [ ] MySQL database connection and connection pooling
- [ ] Redis integration for caching and session storage
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging middleware
- [ ] Health check endpoints for monitoring
- [ ] CORS configuration for frontend integration
- [ ] Request validation middleware setup
- [ ] API documentation foundation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Technical Details
- Use Express.js 4.x with TypeScript for type safety
- Implement layered architecture: Controllers → Services → Repositories
- Configure MySQL connection with connection pooling (mysql2 or similar)
- Setup Redis client with connection retry logic
- Use structured logging (Winston or similar) with proper log levels
- Implement global error handler with proper error response format
- Configure CORS with environment-specific origins
- Setup request validation using Joi or similar schema validation
- Create base service classes for common operations
- Implement health check endpoints for database and Redis connectivity

## Dependencies
- [3] Project Setup and Environment Configuration - Required for base project structure
- [4] Database Schema Design and Setup - Required for database integration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
