# Task: Project Setup and Environment Configuration

## Description
Initialize React frontend and Python backend project structure with TypeScript, setup development environment, configure build tools and linting. This foundational task establishes the core project infrastructure and development toolchain for both frontend (React) and backend (Python/FastAPI) needed for the AI System Prompt Generator application.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Frontend (React)
- [ ] Node.js project initialized with proper package.json structure
- [ ] TypeScript configuration setup with strict type checking
- [ ] React application scaffolded with Vite build tools
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configured for frontend code quality

### Backend (Python)
- [ ] Python project initialized with requirements.txt and pyproject.toml
- [ ] FastAPI application scaffolded with proper project structure
- [ ] Python virtual environment setup and dependency management
- [ ] Black, isort, and flake8 configured for Python code quality

### Development Environment
- [ ] Docker setup for both frontend and backend containers
- [ ] docker-compose.yml for local development with hot reload
- [ ] Environment variable configuration for different deployment stages
- [ ] Development scripts configured for both stacks

## Technical Details

### Frontend Stack
- Use Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn for package management
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode and path mapping
- Setup React 18+ with Vite for fast development and building
- Implement ESLint with TypeScript rules and React plugins
- Configure Prettier for consistent code formatting

### Backend Stack
- Use Python 3.11+ with virtual environment (venv or conda)
- Setup FastAPI with uvicorn for ASGI server
- Configure Black (code formatting), isort (import sorting), flake8 (linting)
- Setup pytest for testing framework
- Use Pydantic for data validation and serialization

### Project Structure
```
project/
├── frontend/          # React TypeScript app
│   ├── src/, public/, tests/
│   └── package.json, tsconfig.json
├── backend/           # Python FastAPI app
│   ├── app/, tests/
│   └── requirements.txt, pyproject.toml
└── docker-compose.yml # Development environment
```

### Development Environment
- Create separate Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
- Setup docker-compose.yml with hot reload for both services
- Configure environment files for different stages
- Setup development scripts for both frontend and backend

## Dependencies
None - This is the foundational task that enables all other development

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
