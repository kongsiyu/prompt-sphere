# Task: Project Setup and Environment Configuration

## Description
Initialize Node.js/React project structure with TypeScript, setup development environment, configure build tools and linting. This foundational task establishes the core project infrastructure and development toolchain needed for the AI System Prompt Generator application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Node.js project initialized with proper package.json structure
- [ ] TypeScript configuration setup with strict type checking
- [ ] React application scaffolded with modern build tools (Vite/Webpack)
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality and formatting
- [ ] Docker setup for containerized development environment
- [ ] Environment variable configuration for different deployment stages
- [ ] Basic folder structure organized following best practices
- [ ] Development scripts configured (start, build, test, lint)

## Technical Details
- Use Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn for package management
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode and path mapping
- Setup React 18+ with modern hooks and functional components
- Implement ESLint with TypeScript rules and React plugins
- Configure Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for local development
- Setup environment files (.env.local, .env.development, .env.production)
- Organize project structure: src/, public/, tests/, docs/, config/

## Dependencies
None - This is the foundational task that enables all other development

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false
