# Task: 钉钉OAuth Authentication Implementation

## Description
Implement 钉钉OAuth integration for user authentication, JWT token management, user session handling, and authorization middleware. This task provides secure authentication through DingTalk's OAuth system, enabling users to login with their corporate accounts and maintain secure sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] DingTalk OAuth 2.0 flow implementation (authorization code grant)
- [ ] User registration and login endpoints with DingTalk integration
- [ ] JWT token generation, validation, and refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Authentication middleware for protected routes
- [ ] User profile management with DingTalk user data sync
- [ ] Session management with Redis storage
- [ ] Role-based access control foundation
- [ ] Logout functionality with token invalidation
- [ ] Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Security headers and CSRF protection

## Technical Details
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with DingTalk APIs using httpx async client
- Use python-jose library for JWT handling with RS256 algorithm
- Store refresh tokens securely in Redis using aioredis with expiration
- Create FastAPI dependency that validates JWT and injects user context
- Implement user service for profile management and role assignment using SQLAlchemy
- Use slowapi (FastAPI rate limiting) for authentication endpoint protection
- Configure security headers using FastAPI middleware
- Implement CSRF protection using FastAPI-CSRF-Protect
- Create async user session management with automatic cleanup using background tasks
- Handle DingTalk API errors gracefully with FastAPI exception handlers and proper user feedback

## Dependencies
- [9] Backend API Server and Core Services Setup - Required for API server foundation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 20
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
