# Task: Unified Prompt Creation and Editing Interface

## Description
Implement the core unified interface for prompt creation and editing with left-right split layout. Left panel contains metadata form (top) and markdown preview (bottom), right panel contains integrated conversation interface with PE Engineer and PEQA agents for creation, optimization, and quality assessment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Left-right split layout with responsive design
- [ ] Left panel: metadata form (role, tone, capabilities, constraints)
- [ ] Left panel: markdown editor with real-time preview
- [ ] Right panel: integrated chat interface with PE Engineer and PEQA
- [ ] Two creation workflows: direct form filling and natural language parsing
- [ ] Real-time synchronization between form, markdown, and conversation
- [ ] Conversation modes: Create, Optimize, and Quality Check
- [ ] Integration with backend LangChain agents (PE Engineer + PEQA)
- [ ] Auto-save functionality for work in progress
- [ ] Basic export to markdown format
