# PEQA Quality Assessment Agent Implementation

## Description

Implement LangChain agent for Quality Assessment role that analyzes prompts, provides comprehensive scores, and suggests specific improvements. This agent ensures prompt quality through systematic evaluation and actionable feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PEQA agent class inheriting from BaseAgent
- [ ] Quality scoring algorithms for multiple dimensions
- [ ] Improvement suggestion engine with specific recommendations
- [ ] Assessment report generation with detailed metrics
- [ ] Integration with Qwen models for analysis
- [ ] Configurable quality criteria and thresholds
- [ ] Performance benchmarking capabilities
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests covering all assessment scenarios

## Technical Details

### Quality Assessment Dimensions
- **Clarity**: How clear and unambiguous is the prompt
- **Specificity**: Level of detail and precision in requirements
- **Completeness**: Coverage of all necessary context and constraints
- **Effectiveness**: Likelihood to produce desired outcomes
- **Robustness**: Resistance to edge cases and misinterpretation

### Key Methods
```python
class PEQAAgent(BaseAgent):
    async def assess_prompt(self, prompt: str) -> QualityAssessment
    async def generate_score(self, assessment: QualityAssessment) -> QualityScore
    async def suggest_improvements(self, assessment: QualityAssessment) -> List[Improvement]
    async def create_report(self, assessment: QualityAssessment) -> AssessmentReport
    async def benchmark_performance(self, prompts: List[str]) -> BenchmarkResults
```

### Assessment Output Structure
```python
@dataclass
class QualityAssessment:
    overall_score: float
    dimension_scores: Dict[str, float]
    strengths: List[str]
    weaknesses: List[str]
    improvement_suggestions: List[Improvement]
    confidence_level: float
```

## Size and Estimation

- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Estimated Hours**: 24
- **Parallel**: true (can work alongside PE Engineer agent)

## Dependencies

- **Depends on**: [6]
  - 6: LangChain framework and base agent architecture

## Notes

This agent should provide objective, actionable feedback that helps users improve their prompts systematically. The quality criteria should be based on established prompt engineering best practices and be configurable for different use cases and domains.
