# Task: Frontend-Backend Integration and API Layer

## Description
Implement comprehensive integration layer between frontend React application and backend FastAPI services, including WebSocket connections for real-time agent conversations, API client with error handling, and state management for the entire application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Type-safe API client with OpenAPI integration
- [ ] WebSocket client for real-time agent conversations
- [ ] Centralized error handling and user feedback
- [ ] API request/response transformation and validation
- [ ] Authentication integration with JWT tokens
- [ ] Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Loading states and optimistic updates
- [ ] Offline detection and graceful degradation
- [ ] API retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Integration testing for all API endpoints

## Technical Details
- Generate TypeScript API client from OpenAPI specifications
- Implement WebSocket connection management with auto-reconnection
- Create React Query setup for server state management
- Build centralized error boundary with toast notifications
- Integrate authentication context with token management
- Implement request/response interceptors for common operations
- Create loading and error UI components
- Build offline detection with proper user feedback
- Set up API mocking for development and testing
- Create integration tests using Mock Service Worker (MSW)
