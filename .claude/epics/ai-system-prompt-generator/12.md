## Metadata
- **Epic**: ai-system-prompt-generator
- **Task ID**: 12
- **Title**: Frontend React Application Setup and Routing
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: high
- **Size**: L
- **Estimated Hours**: 24
- **Parallel**: true
- **Dependencies**: [3, 9]
- **Conflicts**: []

## Description
Setup React application with TypeScript, implement routing structure, create core layout components, integrate state management (React Query + Zustand), setup component library and styling system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React application with TypeScript setup and configured
- [ ] Routing structure implemented with React Router
- [ ] Core layout components (Header, Sidebar, Main, Footer) created
- [ ] State management integration (React Query for server state, Zustand for client state)
- [ ] Component library setup (shadcn/ui or similar)
- [ ] Styling system configured (Tailwind CSS or styled-components)
- [ ] Responsive design foundation established
- [ ] API client setup with proper error handling
- [ ] Authentication state management
- [ ] Theme system (light/dark mode support)
- [ ] Loading states and error boundaries
- [ ] Basic navigation between main application sections

## Technical Requirements
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- React Router v6 for navigation
- React Query for server state management
- Zustand for client state management
- Component library (shadcn/ui recommended)
- Styling solution (Tailwind CSS recommended)
- Responsive design principles
- Proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Error boundaries and loading states
- API client with proper error handling

## Implementation Details
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize React app with TypeScript
   - Configure build tools and development environment
   - Setup linting and formatting rules

2. **Routing Structure**
   - Setup React Router with main application routes
   - Implement route guards for authentication
   - Create route components for main sections

3. **Layout Components**
   - Header with navigation and user menu
   - Sidebar for main navigation
   - Main content area with proper spacing
   - Footer with essential links

4. **State Management**
   - Configure React Query for API calls
   - Setup Zustand stores for client state
   - Implement authentication state management

5. **Component Library**
   - Setup component library (shadcn/ui)
   - Create base components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
   - Establish design system tokens

6. **Styling System**
   - Configure Tailwind CSS or styling solution
   - Setup theme system with CSS variables
   - Implement responsive design utilities

7. **API Integration**
   - Create API client with proper error handling
   - Setup request/response interceptors
   - Implement retry logic and error boundaries

## Files to Create/Modify
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Main application component
- `frontend/src/router/index.tsx` - Main router configuration
- `frontend/src/components/layout/` - Layout components
- `frontend/src/stores/` - Zustand store definitions
- `frontend/src/api/` - API client and hooks
- `frontend/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `frontend/src/styles/` - Global styles and theme
- `frontend/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

## Testing Requirements
- Component unit tests with React Testing Library
- Router navigation tests
- State management tests
- API client tests with mock service worker
- Integration tests for main user flows
- Accessibility tests

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code passes linting and type checking
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for main flows
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Responsive design tested on multiple devices
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Ready for integration with backend API

## Notes
- Focus on establishing solid foundation for future feature development
- Ensure component library choices align with design requirements
- Consider performance implications of state management choices
- Plan for internationalization if required
- Setup proper development and production build configurations
