  - Development tools and build settings
- **Frontend `.env.example`**: React/Vite-specific configuration
- **Enhanced Backend `.env.example`**: Expanded from basic template to comprehensive configuration
  - Database, Redis, and external API settings
  - Monitoring, logging, and security configuration
  - Rate limiting, caching, and health checks

### ✅ Pre-commit Hooks and Development Workflow
- **Created `.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Comprehensive pre-commit configuration
  - Python tools: Black, isort, flake8, mypy, bandit
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: Prettier, ESLint
  - General: YAML, JSON, Markdown linting
  - Security: detect-secrets, vulnerability scanning
  - Docker: Hadolint for Dockerfile linting
- **Created `scripts/setup-dev.sh`**: Unix/Linux/macOS setup script
  - System requirements checking
  - Dependency installation for both stacks
  - Virtual environment setup
  - Pre-commit hooks installation
  - Environment file creation
  - Docker setup and verification
- **Created `scripts/setup-dev.bat`**: Windows-compatible setup script
  - Complete parity with Unix script
  - Windows-specific commands and paths
  - Error handling and user feedback

### ✅ Comprehensive Development Documentation
- **Enhanced `README.md`**: Complete project documentation (350+ lines)
  - Project overview with features and architecture diagrams
  - Quick start and detailed setup instructions
  - Complete command reference
  - Project structure documentation
  - API documentation links
  - Contributing guidelines and testing information
- **Created `DEVELOPMENT.md`**: Extensive developer guide (700+ lines)
  - Detailed development environment setup
  - Code architecture and patterns
  - Development workflow and branching strategy
  - Code quality guidelines and testing strategy
  - Database management and API development
  - Frontend development patterns
  - Debugging, performance, and security guidelines
  - Comprehensive troubleshooting section

### ✅ Unified Commands for Both Stacks
- **Dual Interface**: Both npm scripts and Makefile provide complete coverage
- **Concurrent Operations**: Scripts can run frontend and backend simultaneously
- **Individual Control**: Commands for working with each stack separately
- **Quality Assurance**: Unified linting, testing, and formatting across stacks
- **Docker Integration**: Complete Docker workflow commands
- **Development Lifecycle**: From setup to deployment commands

## Technical Achievements

### Code Quality Infrastructure
- **Zero-config setup**: Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality automatically
- **Consistent formatting**: Black, Prettier, and isort maintain consistent code style
- **Static analysis**: flake8, ESLint, and mypy catch issues early
- **Security scanning**: detect-secrets and bandit prevent security issues
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Tools work on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Developer Experience
- **One-command setup**: Single script sets up complete development environment
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Both quick-start and detailed guides available
- **Multiple interfaces**: npm scripts for Node developers, Makefile for traditionalists
- **Error prevention**: Pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits
- **Environment management**: Template files for easy configuration

### Integration Points
- **Docker compatibility**: All tooling works with Docker development environment
- **IDE support**: Configuration works with VSCode, PyCharm, and other IDEs
- **CI/CD ready**: Pre-commit configuration works with GitHub Actions and other CI systems
- **Dependency management**: Scripts handle both frontend and backend dependencies

## Next Steps for Developers

1. **Run setup script**: `./scripts/setup-dev.sh` or `scripts\setup-dev.bat`
2. **Start development**: `npm run dev` or `make dev`
3. **Read documentation**: Review `README.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md`
4. **Configure environment**: Update `.env.local` and other environment files
5. **Verify setup**: Run `npm run health` to check all services

## Impact

This stream has established a **production-ready development environment** that:

- **Reduces onboarding time** from hours to minutes with automated setup
- **Prevents code quality issues** with automated formatting and linting
- **Standardizes development practices** across the team
- **Provides comprehensive documentation** for all development scenarios
- **Enables confident development** with extensive tooling and safety nets

The development tooling infrastructure created in this stream provides a solid foundation for productive, high-quality development across both frontend and backend stacks.
