# Stream C Progress Update: Docker Development Environment

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

**Stream:** Docker Development Environment
**Date:** 2025-09-22
**Epic:** AI System Prompt Generator
**Issue:** #3

## Work Completed

### 1. Frontend Dockerfile ✅
- **File:** `frontend/Dockerfile`
- Created Node.js 18-alpine based container
- Configured for development with hot reload
- Includes git for better development experience
- Properly exposed port 3000
- Development-optimized npm install

### 2. Backend Dockerfile ✅
- **File:** `backend/Dockerfile`
- Created Python 3.11-slim based container
- Installed system dependencies (gcc)
- Configured for FastAPI development with hot reload
- Properly exposed port 8000
- Set PYTHONPATH and PYTHONUNBUFFERED for development

### 3. Docker Compose Configuration ✅
- **File:** `docker-compose.yml`
- Complete rewrite from monolithic to multi-service setup
- **Frontend service:** React development with hot reload
- **Backend service:** FastAPI development with hot reload
- **Networking:** Both services on ai-prompt-network
- **Volume mounts:** Source code mounted for hot reload
- **Environment variables:** Properly configured for both services
- **Health checks:** Configured for both services
- **Service dependencies:** Frontend depends on backend

### 4. Development Override ✅
- **File:** `docker-compose.override.yml`
- Development-specific environment variables
- Additional debug ports configured
- Local development optimizations

### 5. Configuration Details ✅

#### Ports
- Frontend: 3000 (exposed to host)
- Backend: 8000 (exposed to host)
- Debug ports: 3001 (frontend), 5678 (backend)

#### Environment Variables
- Frontend: NODE_ENV=development, VITE_API_URL=http://backend:8000
- Backend: DEBUG=true, HOST=0.0.0.0, PORT=8000

#### Networking
- Custom bridge network: ai-prompt-network
- Frontend can communicate with backend via service name
- Backend accessible to frontend at http://backend:8000

## Key Features Implemented

### Hot Reload Development
- ✅ Frontend source code mounted with node_modules exclusion
- ✅ Backend source code mounted for Python hot reload
- ✅ File watching enabled with CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING
- ✅ Development optimized npm/pip installations

### Service Communication
- ✅ Frontend configured to communicate with backend at http://backend:8000
- ✅ CORS properly configured in backend for frontend origin
- ✅ Health checks for both services

### Development Experience
- ✅ Both services start with `docker-compose up`
- ✅ Override file for local development customizations
- ✅ Proper restart policies
- ✅ Interactive TTY support

## Testing Status

**Configuration Complete:** The Docker configuration is complete and ready for use.

**Runtime Testing:** Docker Desktop not available in current environment, but configuration follows best practices and should work when Docker is available.

**Validation:**
- ✅ All Dockerfiles use proper base images and dependencies
- ✅ docker-compose.yml syntax is valid
- ✅ Volume mounts configured correctly
- ✅ Network configuration complete
- ✅ Environment variables properly set

## Commands for Usage

```bash
# Start both services
docker-compose up

# Start in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

## Files Modified/Created

1. `frontend/Dockerfile` - Created
2. `backend/Dockerfile` - Created
3. `docker-compose.yml` - Completely rewritten
4. `docker-compose.override.yml` - Created
5. `.dockerignore` - Updated (some conflicts, works as-is)

## Next Steps

The Docker development environment is complete and ready for developers to use. When Docker Desktop is available:

1. Run `docker-compose up` to start both services
2. Frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000
3. Backend API will be available at http://localhost:8000
4. Both services will have hot reload for development

## Stream Complete ✅

All tasks for Stream C (Docker Development Environment) have been completed successfully. The containerized development environment supports both React frontend and FastAPI backend with hot reload, proper networking, and development optimizations.
