- ✅ Setup Vite 7.1.7 as build tool with React plugin
- ✅ Configured TypeScript with strict mode and path mapping (@/ alias)
- ✅ Created complete src/ folder structure:
  - components/ - for React components
  - pages/ - for page-level components
  - hooks/ - for custom React hooks
  - utils/ - for utility functions
  - types/ - for TypeScript type definitions
- ✅ Setup public/ folder with optimized HTML template
- ✅ Created initial React app scaffolding with App.tsx
- ✅ Verified project builds successfully (tsc + vite build)
- ✅ Verified dev server starts on port 3000 (npm run dev)

## Foundation Ready
