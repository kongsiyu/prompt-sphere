# Stream C: Database Connection & ORM

## Scope
Setup MySQL connection pooling, configure SQLAlchemy ORM, and implement database session management

## Files
- `backend/database/connection.py` ✅
- `backend/database/session.py` ✅
- `backend/core/database.py` ✅

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Enhanced Database Connection (backend/database/connection.py)
- ✅ Integrated with Stream A models using proper Base class
- ✅ Added MySQL-specific connection optimizations
- ✅ Implemented connection pooling with QueuePool
- ✅ Added connection event listeners for monitoring
- ✅ Enhanced session management with proper error handling
- ✅ Added health check functions
- ✅ Implemented connection recovery and retry logic

### 2. Advanced Session Management (backend/database/session.py)
- ✅ Created DatabaseSession class with retry logic
- ✅ Implemented exponential backoff for connection errors
- ✅ Added context managers for session and transaction handling
- ✅ Created decorators for automatic session management
- ✅ Implemented SessionManager for concurrent session handling
- ✅ Added utility functions for raw SQL execution
- ✅ Comprehensive session health monitoring

### 3. Core Database Management (backend/core/database.py)
- ✅ Created DatabaseManager for high-level operations
- ✅ Integrated with migration system from Stream B
- ✅ Implemented database lifecycle management
- ✅ Added comprehensive health monitoring
- ✅ Created maintenance task execution
- ✅ Added database backup capabilities
- ✅ Implemented FastAPI lifecycle integration

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- ✅ Enhanced test_database_connection.py with new functionality
- ✅ Created test_database_session.py for session management
- ✅ Created test_core_database.py for database manager
- ✅ All tests use proper mocking without external dependencies
- ✅ Full coverage of error scenarios and edge cases

## Key Features Implemented

### Connection Pooling
- MySQL-optimized connection settings with utf8mb4 charset
- Connection recycling every hour
- Pool size: 10 with max overflow: 20
- Connection timeout: 30 seconds
- Pre-ping validation and server-side cursors

### Session Management
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Proper transaction handling and rollback
- Session lifecycle monitoring
- Multiple session context managers
- Decorator-based session injection

### Health Monitoring
- Connection health checks with database info
- Session management health verification
- Connection pool statistics
- Comprehensive health reporting
- HTTP endpoint helpers for health checks

### Error Handling & Recovery
- Automatic connection recovery on failures
- Proper session rollback on exceptions
- Graceful degradation on partial failures
- Detailed error logging and monitoring

### Database Lifecycle
- Application startup/shutdown handling
- Migration integration
- Database reset capabilities
- Maintenance task execution
- Schema backup functionality

## Integration Notes
- Successfully integrated with Stream A models (uses shared Base class)
- Compatible with Stream B migration system
- Ready for integration with API layer
- Follows async/await patterns throughout
- Proper logging and monitoring integration

## Next Steps
Stream C is complete. The database connection and ORM layer is fully implemented and tested, ready for use by the application layer.
