# Task: 阿里百炼DashScope API Integration

## Description
Integrate 阿里百炼DashScope API for Qwen model access to enable AI-powered prompt generation and optimization. Implement a robust API client with proper authentication, error handling, rate limiting, and response processing for seamless interaction with Alibaba's large language models.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] DashScope API client implemented with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Authentication mechanism setup with API key management
- [ ] Request/response handling for Qwen model interactions
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic for failed requests
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation to respect API quotas
- [ ] Response streaming support for real-time output
- [ ] Configuration management for different model parameters
- [ ] Logging and monitoring for API usage tracking
- [ ] Unit tests covering all API integration scenarios

## Technical Details
- Use Alibaba DashScope SDK or implement REST client with axios/fetch
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for API requests/responses
- Setup environment-based API key configuration
- Implement exponential backoff for retry logic
- Add request queuing system for rate limit management
- Support for different Qwen model variants (qwen-turbo, qwen-plus, qwen-max)
- Implement streaming responses for better user experience
- Add comprehensive error mapping and user-friendly messages
- Include request/response logging for debugging and analytics

## Dependencies
None - API integration is independent of other components

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
