# Task: 阿里百炼DashScope API Integration

## Description
Integrate 阿里百炼DashScope API for Qwen model access to enable AI-powered prompt generation and optimization. Implement a robust API client with proper authentication, error handling, rate limiting, and response processing for seamless interaction with Alibaba's large language models.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] DashScope Python SDK integrated with proper class structure
- [ ] Authentication mechanism setup with API key management
- [ ] Request/response handling for Qwen model interactions
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic for failed requests with custom exceptions
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation using asyncio to respect API quotas
- [ ] Async response streaming support for real-time output
- [ ] Pydantic models for configuration and model parameters
- [ ] Structured logging and monitoring for API usage tracking
- [ ] Pytest test suite covering all API integration scenarios

## Technical Details
- Use Alibaba DashScope Python SDK (dashscope package)
- Implement Pydantic models for API requests/responses and configuration
- Setup environment-based API key configuration using pydantic-settings
- Implement async exponential backoff for retry logic using asyncio
- Add async request queuing system for rate limit management
- Support for different Qwen model variants (qwen-turbo, qwen-plus, qwen-max)
- Implement async streaming responses with FastAPI streaming
- Add comprehensive error mapping with custom Python exceptions
- Include structured logging using Python logging module for debugging and analytics
- Create service layer with dependency injection pattern for FastAPI

## Dependencies
None - API integration is independent of other components

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
