# LangChain Framework Setup and Agent Architecture

## Description

Setup LangChain framework and implement base agent architecture to create an agent orchestration system for PE Engineer and PEQA roles. This task establishes the foundation for AI agent interactions and management.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] LangChain framework installed and configured
- [ ] Base agent classes implemented with common interfaces
- [ ] Agent orchestration logic for managing multiple agents
- [ ] Agent communication patterns and message passing
- [ ] Configuration management for agent parameters
- [ ] Error handling and logging for agent operations
- [ ] Unit tests for base agent functionality

## Technical Details

### Components to Implement
- `BaseAgent` abstract class with common agent interface
- `AgentOrchestrator` for managing multiple agents
- Agent communication protocols and message types
- Configuration system for agent parameters
- Integration with DashScope API for LLM access

### File Structure
```

├── agents/
│   ├── base/
│   │   ├── BaseAgent.py
│   │   ├── AgentOrchestrator.py
│   │   └── MessageTypes.py
│   └── config/
│       └── AgentConfig.py
```

## Size and Estimation

- **Size**: M (Medium)
- **Estimated Hours**: 16
- **Parallel**: false (blocking task for other agents)

## Dependencies

- **Depends on**: [3, 5]
  - 3: Project setup and basic structure
  - 5: DashScope API integration for LLM access

## Notes

This is a foundational task that must be completed before implementing specific agent roles. The architecture should be flexible enough to support different agent types while maintaining consistency in communication patterns.
