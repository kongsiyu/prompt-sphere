# Database Schema Design Decisions

## Architecture Overview

The AI System Prompt Generator database schema is designed with the following core principles:
- **Scalability**: UUID primary keys and horizontal scaling support
- **Performance**: Strategic indexing and query optimization
- **Data Integrity**: Strong referential integrity with appropriate cascading
- **Auditability**: Comprehensive audit logging for compliance
- **Flexibility**: JSON columns for extensible metadata
- **Security**: Built-in security features and access controls

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Primary Key Strategy: UUIDs vs Auto-Increment

**Decision**: Use UUID (CHAR(36)) primary keys across all tables.

**Rationale**:
- **Distributed Systems**: UUIDs allow for distributed data generation without coordination
- **Security**: No information leakage about record counts or creation order
- **Merging**: Easy to merge data from different environments without ID conflicts
- **API Design**: UUIDs are better for public APIs (no guessable IDs)
- **Sharding**: Natural sharding key for horizontal scaling

**Trade-offs**:
- Slightly larger storage footprint (36 bytes vs 4-8 bytes)
- No natural ordering (addressed with created_at timestamps)
- Less human-readable in debugging (mitigated with proper tooling)

**Implementation**: MySQL's UUID() function generates RFC 4122 compliant UUIDs.

### 2. Soft Delete Pattern

**Decision**: Implement soft delete using `deleted_at` timestamp across all user-generated content.

**Rationale**:
- **Data Recovery**: Accidental deletions can be recovered
- **Audit Compliance**: Maintains complete audit trail
- **Referential Integrity**: Preserves relationships even after "deletion"
- **Analytics**: Historical data remains available for analysis
- **User Experience**: "Undelete" functionality possible

**Scope**: Applied to users, templates, conversations, and prompts.

**Implementation**:
```sql
deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL
-- NULL = active record
-- Non-NULL = soft deleted with deletion timestamp
```

### 3. JSON Columns for Flexible Data

**Decision**: Use JSON columns for extensible metadata and configuration.

**Usage**:
- **User Preferences**: Theme, language, notification settings
- **Template Variables**: Dynamic template parameters
- **Conversation Context**: Session state and settings
- **Prompt Metadata**: AI model parameters and custom data
- **Audit Details**: Change tracking and additional context

**Benefits**:
- Schema evolution without migrations
- Rich data structures for complex configurations
- Native JSON query support in MySQL 8.0+
- Reduced need for additional tables

**Constraints**:
- Validation at application level
- Indexing limitations on nested data
- Migration complexity for structural changes

### 4. Timestamp Strategy

**Decision**: Three-timestamp pattern for lifecycle tracking.

**Pattern**:
```sql
created_at   TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
updated_at   TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
deleted_at   TIMESTAMP NULL     -- For soft delete
```

**Benefits**:
- Complete lifecycle tracking
- Automatic maintenance by database
- Consistent across all tables
- Supports temporal queries and analytics

### 5. Audit Logging Design

**Decision**: Comprehensive audit table with flexible structure.

**Features**:
- **Universal Auditing**: Single table for all entity types
- **Change Tracking**: Before/after values with computed differences
- **Rich Context**: IP address, user agent, session tracking
- **Flexible Metadata**: JSON column for additional context
- **Security Focus**: Special handling for authentication events

**Structure**:
```sql
entity_type VARCHAR(100)  -- What was changed
entity_id   CHAR(36)      -- Which specific record
action      ENUM(...)     -- What action was performed
old_values  JSON          -- State before change
new_values  JSON          -- State after change
changes     JSON          -- Computed differences
```

### 6. User Authentication & Security

**Decision**: Built-in security features with extensible design.

**Security Features**:
- Password hashing (bcrypt recommended)
- Account locking after failed attempts
- Email verification workflow
- Password reset tokens
- Session tracking
- Role-based access control

**Extensibility**:
- Preferences JSON for user customization
- Audit logging for all security events
- Support for external authentication providers

### 7. Template System Architecture

**Decision**: Hierarchical template system with versioning and sharing.

**Features**:
- **Versioning**: Parent-child relationships for template evolution
- **Sharing**: Public/private templates with ownership tracking
- **Rating System**: Community ratings with average calculation
- **Usage Analytics**: Track template popularity and performance
- **Variable System**: Support for parameterized templates

**Benefits**:
- Community-driven template library
- Template evolution tracking
- Quality assessment through ratings
- Performance optimization through usage data

### 8. Conversation Management

**Decision**: Hierarchical conversation system with collaboration support.

**Architecture**:
- **Ownership**: Each conversation has a primary owner
- **Participants**: Support for shared conversations
- **Status Tracking**: Active, archived, paused, completed states
- **Activity Monitoring**: Last activity tracking for UI/UX
- **Sharing**: Token-based public sharing
- **Metrics**: Token usage and cost tracking

**Benefits**:
- Collaborative prompt engineering
- Organized conversation management
- Cost transparency for users
- Performance monitoring

### 9. Prompt Processing Model

**Decision**: Comprehensive prompt-response tracking with performance metrics.

**Data Captured**:
- **Complete Interaction**: User input, system prompt, AI response
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time, token usage, cost
- **Model Information**: AI model used, parameters, version
- **Quality Metrics**: User ratings and feedback
- **Relationships**: Template usage, conversation context, prompt chains

**Benefits**:
- Complete interaction history
- Performance optimization data
- Cost analysis and budgeting
- Quality improvement feedback loop
- AI model comparison data

### 10. Indexing Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-layered indexing approach for different query patterns.

**Index Types**:
1. **Primary Keys**: Clustered indexes for fast lookups
2. **Foreign Keys**: Non-clustered indexes for JOIN performance
3. **Search Columns**: Composite indexes for common filters
4. **Full-Text**: Natural language search capabilities
5. **Temporal**: Time-based queries and analytics
6. **Security**: Audit and monitoring queries

**Performance Targets**:
- Sub-second response for user dashboard queries
- Fast template discovery and search
- Efficient conversation history retrieval
- Real-time audit log analysis
